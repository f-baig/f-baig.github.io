Hello! I am a current undergradute studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Yale University. 

My interests lie in financial modeling (particularly as it relates to volatility), ML inference optimization, distributed systems, and low latency systems. I'm also quite interested in the startup space and venture capital.

Below I have listed my current experience, as well as any relevant contact links.
